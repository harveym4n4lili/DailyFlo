## File-Based Routing Structure ```(/app)```
### Core Routes
* ```(tabs)/``` - Tab-based navigation structure
* ```(auth)/``` - Authentication flow screens
* ```(onboarding)/``` - First-time user experience
* ```(modals)/``` - Modal presentations
### Route Organization
* Dynamic routes: TBD
* Layout files: _layout.tsx for nested layouts
* Loading states: loading.tsx for route-level loading
* Error boundaries: error.tsx for error handling

## Component Architecture (/components)
### Folder Structure
```
components/
├── ui/                    # Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
├── forms/                 # Form-specific components
├── navigation/            # Navigation-related components
├── features/              # Feature-specific components
└── layout/                # Layout and container components
```
### Component Organization Principles
* One component per file
* Co-located styles and tests
* Index files for clean imports
* Component composition patterns

## State Management ```(/store)```
### Store Structure
Global state organization
Feature-based state slices
Middleware configuration
Persistence strategies
### State Patterns
Local vs global state decisions
Optimistic updates
Cache management
Offline state handling

## Services Layer ```(/services)```
### API Integration
HTTP client configuration
Authentication handling
Request/response interceptors
Error handling patterns
### External Services
Analytics integration
Push notification services
Third-party API integrations
Background sync services

## Custom Hooks ```(/hooks)```
### Hook Categories
Data fetching hooks
Form handling hooks
Navigation hooks
Device-specific hooks (camera, location, etc.)
### Hook Organization
Single responsibility principle
Reusability patterns
Performance optimization
Testing strategies

## Type Definitions ```(/types)```
### Type Organization
API response types
Component prop types
Navigation parameter types
Store state types
### TypeScript Standards
Interface vs type usage
Generic type patterns
Utility type usage
Type guards and assertions

## Asset Management ```(/assets)```
### Asset Organization
```
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── illustrations/
│   └── backgrounds/
├── fonts/
└── animations/
```
### Asset Optimization
Image compression standards
SVG vs PNG usage
Font loading strategies
Animation file formats

## Configuration Files
### Environment Configuration
Development vs production configs
Feature flags setup
API endpoint management
Build-time variables
### Tool Configuration
ESLint and Prettier setup
TypeScript configuration
Metro bundler customization
Testing framework setup
