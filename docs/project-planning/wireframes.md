## Visual Design Direction
### Design System References
Links to existing design systems, style guides, or component libraries being used:
* React Native's foundatiional component library
* (possibly) Lucide React Icon Library for consistent icon usage
* Typography: (TBD)
* Color Palette: minimalist approach (TBD)
### Key Design Principles
3-5 guiding principles that inform design decisions.
1. **Clarity comes first:** every interface element has a clear purpose
2. **Effortless Interaction:** minimize friction in user flows towards task creation and and management
3. **Contextual Awareness:** Surface the right info based on user context
4. **Consistent Rhythm:** Maintain visual and interaction consistency across all screens
5. **Purposeful Animation:** Motion can be used to guide attention and create seamless transistions.
### Accessibility Requirements
WCAG compliance level and specific accessibility considerations.
* **Screen Reader Support:** Full VoiceOver/TalkBack compatibility with semantic labels (future feature)
* **Motion Sensitivity:** Respect user preferences for reduced motion

## Responsive Design
### Breakpoint Strategy
Desktop, tablet, and mobile considerations with specific breakpoints.
(TBD)
### Progressive Enhancement
How the experience adapts across devices and screen sizes.
* **Core Experience:** Essential task management functionality works across all devices
(future features:)
* **Enhanced Features**: Advanced gestures, multi-selection, and drag-and-drop on larger screens
* **Adaptive Layouts:** Single-column on mobile, multi-column on tablets with contextual sidebars
* **Input Optimization:** Touch-first design scales up to support keyboard and mouse interactions
* **Performance Scaling:** Animations and transitions adapt to device capabilities

## Performance & Technical Considerations
### Loading States
How content appears during loading and what users see while waiting.

### Error Handling
Error message patterns and recovery flows
### Technical Constraints
* **Initial Launch:** Branded splash screen with progress indicator for first-time setup
* **Data Loading:** Skeleton screens that mirror final content structure
* **Image Loading:** Progressive loading with blur-to-sharp transitions
* **Offline Indicators:** Clear visual feedback when operating in offline mode
* **Empty States:** Engaging illustrations and helpful onboarding prompts
