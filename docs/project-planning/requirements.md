# Project Planning/Requirements Document
## Problem Statement
### What problem does this solve?
Many people struggle with daily task organization and fail to maintain consistent routines. Existing task management apps are either too complex (overwhelming users with features they don't need) or too simple (lacking essential features like recurring tasks and calendar views).
People need a clean, intuitive way to:
- See what they need to do today without distractions
- Set up recurring weekly tasks without complicated scheduling
- View their tasks across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Quickly add tasks without navigating through multiple screens
### Target Users?
Primary: Working adults (19-40) with structured lifestyles who need simple daily organization.
- Busy professionals balancing work and personal life
- Parents managing family schedules alongside work responsibilities
- Freelancers and consultants juggling multiple projects
- Students managing academic and personal tasks
### What are the core pain points?
1. **Cognitive overload:** Existing apps have too many features
2. **Poor recurring task support:** Existing apps make it difficult to set up manage weekly routines
3. **Slow task entry:** Adding a task should not require too much tapping
4. **Desktop-focused design:** Most task apps aren't optimized for mobile-first usage
5. **Lack of time-based views:** Users want to see daily focus AND monthly planning in one app
