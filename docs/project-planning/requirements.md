# Project Planning/Requirements Document
## Problem Statement
### What problem does this solve?
Many people struggle with daily task organization and fail to maintain consistent routines. Existing task management apps are either too complex (overwhelming users with features they don't need) or too simple (lacking essential features like recurring tasks, task organization, and calendar views).
People need a clean, intuitive way to:
- See what they need to do today without distractions
- Organize tasks into meaningful categories and lists
- Set up recurring weekly tasks without complicated scheduling
- View their tasks across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Quickly add tasks with comprehensive details through guided workflows
- Browse and manage all their tasks in an organized, visual way
- Access their tasks through a mobile-first, touch-optimized interface
### Target Users?
Primary: Working adults (19-40) with structured lifestyles who need simple daily organization.
- Busy professionals balancing work and personal life
- Parents managing family schedules alongside work responsibilities
- Freelancers and consultants juggling multiple projects
- Students managing academic and personal tasks
### What are the core pain points?
1. **Cognitive overload:** Existing apps have too many features and complex interfaces
2. **Poor task organization:** Existing apps lack intuitive ways to categorize and organize tasks
3. **Inadequate recurring task support:** Existing apps make it difficult to set up and manage weekly routines
4. **Slow task entry:** Adding a task with comprehensive details requires too much navigation
5. **Desktop-focused design:** Most task apps aren't optimized for mobile-first, touch-based usage
6. **Limited time-based views:** Users want to see daily focus, weekly planning, AND monthly overview in one app
7. **Poor visual organization:** Existing apps lack color coding and visual cues for quick task recognition
8. **Inconsistent user experience:** Apps don't provide guided workflows for complex tasks like task creation
